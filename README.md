WordBox is my version of the classic Hasbro game Boggle.

I've written this game on many platforms in many different languages and technologies over the decades, this being the latest incarnation. The code is by no means pretty or written with best-practices, it is simply written quickly in a couple of days as a labor of love for logical games. Enjoy!
